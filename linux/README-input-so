The file input.so is the results of partially building the L000-515 package.

    cd L000-515/lua-linux-headers
    make

This results in the input.so file found here.

The Lua test scripts require this to operate and for it to be in the cpath and
inside a linux directory.


At some point, a better method of accessing this library should be implemented.
Probably building the 000-515 package completely and installing it.
