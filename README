Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

The Rinstrum Lua Library can be used in multiple ways.

On PC:
The library can be used on a pc by requiring rinApp.lua. This can be done by
writing the new Lua script within the same folder that rinApp.lua is stored in,
or by changing the require statement to the remote location of rinApp.lua.

This can also be done by modifying the package.path variable in your Lua 
script.

On module:
The library can be used on the module the same way it can be used on the PC, 
but if the libraries are being used for multiple applications it is possible
to save space by copying the contents of '/src' to '/usr/local/share/lua/5.1'.

After this has been done, the contents of '/test' can be executed from anywhere
on the module.
