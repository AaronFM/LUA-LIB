The M4223 Lua module is a very capable device.

## Memory
The M4223 has a total of 64 Mbytes of onboard flash memory and supports an onboard file system
that typically ships with around 40 Mbytes of free space to store custom scripts and data.

## USB
The USB host port is supported with USB drivers for all generic devices including keyboards, barcode readers, ticket printers, serial ports, bluetooth, and flash memory sticks.  It is therefore possible to extend the memory capacity of the M4223 using external storage.

The USB port fully supports the use of USB hubs including externally powered hubs so the range of connectivity options is not restricted
