To make a release of this:

    make clean
    <edit opkg/CONTROL/control and bump the version number>
    make
    make checksum

Look at the checksum file created by the last step (in M01) and add this
to the checksums file at the top of the list.

Commit everything to git and go to L000-517 to build the mega package.
